# Problem Statement

Kiva Zip is a NPO for that crowdsources loans for small businesses. 
Kiva needs a way to connect the lenders and borrowers on a more personal level. 
Lenders would love to support these businesses by not just funding their loans but also buy products from these businesses and review the products that they have helped create! 
Borrowers would love to get business and feedback from lenders who have helped create their businesses. 
Currently, Kiva Zip website does not have a personal messaging system and prospective business buyers might be reluctant to share personal information over the public forums that Kiva currently has. 

In order to facilitate this close connection, Team 5 is going to provide a Marketplaces portal for Kiva Zip where businesses will be able to showcase their final goods that the borrowers will be able to see (and buy if they wish - links to the buyer's website will be provided) and sort them by location, owners and industry.  
Along with this, we will provide a messaging system for lenders and borrowers to interact on a more personal and private system.
